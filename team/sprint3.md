# Sprint 3 - *T25* - *NO NAME GROUP*

## Goal

### A web based solution with shorter trips and a large data source.

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan 

User stories (epics) in the Sprint Backlog: #92, #94, #102

Total planned tasks / issues in the Sprint Backlog: #101, #105, #104, #103, #100, #99, #98,

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* *2-Opt Optimization* #94 : Change data structure that 2opt is modifying
* *Web Server* #92 : [comments]
* *Database* #102 : Has the code to return a set of ID's as per stage 2, but only uses the search string query method.
* *Map Background* #93 : [comments]

Completed *number of issues completed* issues associated with these user stories.

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* Web Server : [ what went wrong ]
* Map Background : [ what went wrong ] 

#### What went well
* We've discovered a convient way to code and communicate: using voice chat and screen sharing from home.
* Collaboration on challenging objectives, greatly reducing time spent on time intensive tasks.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Primarily, getting a working demo (not necessarily the requirements of our assignment, but a functioning project, end to end) early enough. **Resolution** Get all the components talking to eachother early on in the sprint. This will allow much better testing and we can be sure that we will have *something* to show during the demo.
* Keeping up with our plan is an issue (sorry), and splitting up tasks into elements that we can each pick up and do in the estimated time. **Resolution** We've had some experience with the project now, so our estimations are probably better, and we hopefully crank through the next plan in less time with more issues.


## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | More weekly meetings |  | Closing up issues as we complete them
What we did well | Communication of objectives and constructive collaboration on challenging material. |  | 
What we need to work on | Communication of established deadlines to ensure sprint will be completed on time. | Better use of planning to track progress and to keep the pace. | Use scrum to establish better baselines on goals and timeframes.
What we will change next time |  |  |
