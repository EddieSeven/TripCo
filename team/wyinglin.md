### ISTP

	1. I am easiest to reach by text, but email should work, it will just take slightly longer for me to get back to you. I have a flexible work schedule, so I can be reached at waking hours. If it’s too late, I probably won’t get back to you until the next day.
	2. I expect we will do all of our assignments on time, and with a fair amount of effort put forward by each group member.
	3. I haven’t worked in a group on any coding projects before, so I’m hoping this will be a learning experience for me.
	4. Some obstacles might be challenges presented by the assignment itself, but also schedule coordination, and hopefully not, a lack of contribution by some team members.
	5. I don’t think anyone in the group should be aiming for a B. We should always work on completing every part of the assignment as well as we can. I don’t have a problem if we can’t always make it to an A, but that should always be the goal.
	6. I think that is acceptable in some circumstances, but if it becomes the same people, always working more than others to raise the grade, then it becomes a problem.
	7. I think every group member should contribute 2-3 hours per week on the assignment, and with all of us that should be enough to finish in the time allotted. If it takes more, we can cope with that, but it seems fair that every person contribute a roughly equal amount of time.
	8. I think volunteering on parts of the project where an team members strengths lie is the best way. If there is a part that no group member wants to do, random selection would be the best option.
	9. Missing a deadline in a system like this affects the whole group, and puts a large strain on the group dynamic. I think the group should discuss this, and if it is a recurring problem, we should discuss it with the teacher.
	10. If people have different opinions on the quality of the work, I think it should be put to the other group members. If a majority agrees that it needs to be improved, then it should be.
	11. I’m not sure how work habits will become a problem. Most of the work should be done individually. As long as people meet the deadlines for their contributions, their work habits are their business.
	12. I think a standard meeting time outside of class is a good idea, just to check in with everyone on their contributions. This could be digital however.
	13. I think a check in meeting once or twice a week would be enough to keep everyone working well.
	14. Well it depends on the decision. If it affects the overall project, and not just one person’s contribution, then it makes sense to consult the group. However, I think a majority is more necessary than a unanimous decision.
	15. I think the majority should rule in a situation like that. Ideally there would be a compromise, but if there isn’t, one team member shouldn’t stop the others from doing something they all agree on.
	16. I don’t think one person leading the group would be harmful. However, if that person is suppressing ideas they don’t agree with rather than discussing them, the rest of the group should discuss changing that dynamic.
	17. Facilitation, getting everyone to do their work, is best if it doesn’t need to be done. However, if that responsibility fell on me, I don’t think it would be a problem. One team member guiding the group could be a positive thing.
