# Sprint 4 - 25 - NO NAME GROUP

## Goal

### Worldwide trips!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v4.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>4.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* #130:  database implementation of worldwide trip and SVG rendered with path

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* #148: 3-opt was not able to be implemented due to roadblocks in development on sprint
* #147: Write Function to Select Optimization Algorithm

#### What went well
* Processes were streamlined
* Communication of the encountered issues

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* When roadblocks were encountered, help by the TA's should have been sought out at an earlier time.

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | Collaboration on roadblocks that impede sprint progress | Establish TA hours for group to collabrate together on | 
What we did well | Communication of issues that are causing problems | Sharing information on discord that is pertinant to the entire group | 
What we need to work on | Get help earlier before issues snowball |  |
What we will change next time | As a team, asking for help when we need it | Consistent updating and merging to master where possible |
