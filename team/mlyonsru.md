### INFJ

	1.	Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?
		Text. Any time during the day, evening preferred.

	2.	What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
		To pace ourselves for each project and put enough effort into planning the coding part doesn’t become a nightmare

	3.	What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
		To be better prepared for meetings and to have more confidence when speaking. 

	4.	What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
		The allure to be lazy and various neuroses. 

	5.	What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
		No one is inherently right there. Some people will have different priorities and they aren’t wrong for not wanting to get the best possible grade. My suggestion would be a compromise where the B people promise to try their best and the A people try to lower their expectations slightly. However, I am pretty much in the "Get an A" camp.

	6.	Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
		Even though the teacher said this strategy would not work, they are still trying to sneak in and take away from someone else's grade, so it's absolutely not okay.

	7.	How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
		Maybe 6-9 hours a week.

	8.	How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
		I think everyone should talk about their strengths and weaknesses and from there democratically assign everyone. If there is a conflict on a role, use a method to randomly select someone

	9.	What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
		If it is one time it shouldn’t be a big deal. But if it happens often enough then there should be a team meeting and if need be a meeting with the instructor.

	10.	What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
		Have a discussion about it, but try to keep it civil and without invoking blame or getting too personal.

	11.	How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
		This is something that just has to be worked out practically. There is a wide range of acceptable work habits, and as long as everyone falls in that range then there shouldn’t be any conflict, even if some team members are less productive than others.

	12.	Do you want to have a standard meeting time outside of class?
		I said yes before, but after thinking about it I changed my mind to only if necessary. A meeting for the meetings sake won't do anyone any good.

	13.	How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
		Maybe once or twice a week.

	14.	Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
		Depends on how big the decision is. But the minutiae needn't be shared between everyone.

	15.	What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
		Discuss and if possible split the difference.

	16.	What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
		Let them know politely. People can’t read everyone’s minds, so if it’s causing a problem first things first is to bring it to their attention.

	17.	What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
		As above, the first step is to let everyone know how you’re feeling. If that doesn’t fix the problem, then maybe you’ll have to convene a meeting with the teacher.
