# T25 Retrospective for Sprint 1

Area | What we did well | What we need to work on | What we will change
:--- | :------- | :--------- | :---------------------
**Teamwork** | Made sure everyone stayed on top of their assigned portion throughout the sprint. Worked with each other to solve problems that arose.  | We should work on testing each other's work more often, and with more cases, to ensure the product is being scrutinized from as many angles as possible.  | Reviewers should not only read the code, they should pull the code onto their own machines and test it. We will also set aside more time at the end of the sprint to test the code on a variety of inputs.
**Process** | Established clear and effective communication to assist in reaching and meeting our goals with time to spare. | Find ways to help each other become better programmers that will set us a bar above the rest. | Remain open to new ways of thought and methodology that can encourage more effective personal growth.
**Tools** | Minor changes aside, ensuring that any merge into master is reviewed by at least one other person. | Better use of the the issues system. | In each pull request, we should reference the issue that the pull request involves. We will also make use of the assignment operation for issues.

Review your team's efforts during the last sprint and complete the table above, identifying one or two changes for the next Sprint.  At the end of the next sprint you will reflect on the changes you made.  

A simple sentence or two in each table cell is sufficient.  There is limited formatting within table cells.
