### INTJ

	1.	Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?
		Texting is preferable. 8AM - 11:30PM. 

	2.	What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
		All goals being met on time and quality work being submitted without cramming the assignment within a day of it being due.

	3.	What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
		My personal goals are to remain humble and ensure that communication is clear and consistent. 

	4.	What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
		Expectations should be set that we should all perform equally to ensure success with the project. 

	5.	What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
		Effort should be put in to ensure the highest grade possible. Slacking will only serve as a disservice to yourself and your team.

	6.	Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
		It is unacceptable to reward unscrupulous behavior. The tasks that are divided amongst the team must be completed. If circumstances occur that dictate a restructure or change, no one will be left with more than an equal share of the work.

	7.	How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
		Depends on the goals for the week and what needs to be accomplished.

	8.	How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
		A reasonable division of work and an account for ones strengths and weakness should be considering in delegating tasks.

	9.	What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
		Depends on the circumstances. If lack of action has a justifiable reason, then it will be considered if it was brought up in a reasonable time. Otherwise the lack of action is most likely of selfish nature. 

	10.	What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
		A standard must be met. Anyone taking this class that has proceeded this far into their degree will understand the effort required to ensure the letter grade is met.

	11.	How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
		People code in different environments and ways than I do. As long as the work is being done, no problems should occur.

	12.	Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
		Not unless there needs to be. Arrangements can easily be made if there does need to be a meeting.

	13.	How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
		See above answer.

	14.	Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
		This isn’t a hand holding exercise. Ensuring that choices are made for the greater good of the team ensures success for us all. 

	15.	What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
		The majority rules. If everyone disagrees with you, there may be a valid reason. I expect myself and others to be honest with themselves about goals and expectations toward themselves and their team.

	16.	What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
		An aggressive work ethic is nothing to shame, but it does need to be channeled correctly if the person becomes a hindrance to the success of other members on the team.

	17.	What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
		If goals and expectations are not being met, a conversation about the root of the issue should be presented.
