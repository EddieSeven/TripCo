### Personality Type: ENTP-A


1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else? What
hours? Email.
Availability when I have work: early morning (before 9:30AM), afternoon (12-3pm),
Nights after 7.

2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
The assignments asked of us.

3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills
this semester? This is my first time developing as a part of a team, so my goal is to get that
workflow down, since this method of working is the industry standard.

4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and
personal goals? Communication and organization are usually the biggest obstacles in a team, so
those would be the biggest obstacles to tackle.

5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B”
will be acceptable? We can’t decide what grade we’re going to get, we can just put forth our best
work. If everyone does that, we should end up in a good place.

6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order
to get an “A”? Work should be delegated equally throughout the team.

7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project
successful? 6-10 hours per week, per person.

8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
We should meet and identify the strengths of each team member, and decide as a
group based on that, and performance metrics going forward.

9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing
deadline, no show, etc.)? Brought to the attention of the professor, and if the problem persists, remove the
team member, splitting his tasks up equally across the remaining members.

10. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work? There should be a set of standards we adhere to when writing our code. That’s
the judge by which our work should be measured, not subjective opinions of an individual.

11. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
Depends on what those work habits are. Some don’t need to be dealt with, others
might cause some sort of response or reply.

12. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
It’s probably a good idea, but also depends on schedules and work habits of team
members. Online meeting spaces can be as effective as in person meetings,
depending on the people involved.

13. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
Twice a week.

14. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
No, but we will need approval to push code to master.

15. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
Democracy rule - the dissenting opinion is heard but not acted upon.

16. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process? Call it out.

17. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
Call it out, and bring it to the attention of the professor if the issue persists.
